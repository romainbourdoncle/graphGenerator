# graphGenerator

## Description
This script generates a random graph (based on the $G(n, p)$ model) and displays it in TikZ format for use in a LaTeX document.

In Version 5.0, the graph is exported in TikZ format to the console. Version 5.2 further generates a standalone LaTeX document and compiles it into a PDF.
